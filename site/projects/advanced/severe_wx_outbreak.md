## Description

For this project, students choose a historical severe weather event of their choosing (ex. 27 April 2011) and create maps to analyze the case. Typical synoptic and mesoscale analysis maps can be created using the methods within the examples below. If you are looking for potential events to use, use [this list from the NWS office in Northern Indiana](https://www.weather.gov/iwx/decade_weather_2010_2019) or [events from NWS Mobile CWA](https://www.weather.gov/mob/events)! Feel free to stop by the virtual Unidata both during AMS if you have questions or want to chat about other potential severe weather events to use (they do not neccessarily need to be severe storms, think snow events, droughts, etc.).
